									<h3 id="ButtonA">A. What is immunisation & vaccine?</h3>
									<p id="text" class="normal"><b>Have you ever wondered how a simple shot could protect you from life-threatening disease? That’s the power of immunisation and vaccines at work! But, what is immunisation and vaccines?</b> Immunisation refers to the process of getting a vaccine and then becoming immune to the disease. While, vaccination is the term used for getting a vaccine, in the form of injection or oral dose. </p>
									<p id="text" class="normal"><b>Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way to protect yourself from life-threatening diseases before you even encounter it.</b> It boosts your body’s natural defences, making your immune system stronger. Vaccines <b> teach your immune system to recognize and fight specific infections by creating antibodies,</b> just like when your body fights off a fever naturally. Vaccines use weakened or inactive viruses or bacteria, so they do not cause the disease or any complications.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p id="text" class="normal"><b>Here's the cool part: Vaccines are designed to prevent diseases instead of treating them after you're already sick.</b>They create a 'memory' in your immune system, so it can fight off the same infection if you're exposed in the future. This protection can last years or for life, this is why vaccines are so powerful at keeping you healthy.</p>
									<p id="text" class="normal">Another thing that makes vaccines unique is that they're <b> made from biological materials, not chemicals like most medicines.</b>This makes them more complicated and expensive to handle, but less stable than chemicals and vulnerable to temperature changes. Because of this, vaccines need to be kept at specific temperatures to stay effective. Most vaccines need to be refrigerated, but some can be stored at room temperature, which is pretty neat! <b> So, next time you get a vaccine, remember that you're giving your immune system powers to keep you safe from life-threatening diseases!</b></p>
									<hr />
									<h3 id="ButtonB">B. Your Immune System</h3>
									<p id="text" class="normal"><b>Imagine your body as a fortress, constantly defending itself against unseen invaders called microbes. The immune system is the body's defender against those unrecognised microbes.</b> And your immune system is equipped with a special and complex network of organs, cells, and proteins to protect you and fight infections. So, let's meet the key players of your immune system:</p>
									<ol>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>White Blood Cells: </b>White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are the <b> frontline soldiers of your immune system.</b> They are produced in the bone marrow and move through the bloodstream and tissues, <b>searching for and attacking foreign invaders</b> such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. These cells include lymphocytes (B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells) as well as other types of immune cells.</li>
										<br/>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Antibodies: </b> Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are specialised proteins produced by certain white blood cells called B-lymphocytes. These antibodies play a <b> crucial role in recognizing and neutralising harmful microbes or toxins they produce. </b> First, they mark the microbe or toxin as being foreign. Then, they bind to specific antigens on their surfaces, marking them for destruction with the help of other immune cells.</li>
										<br/>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Lymphatic System: </b> The lymphatic system is a complex network of vessels, nodes (glands), and organs that work together to <b> maintain fluid balance, transport immune cells, and filter out harmful substances. </b> The lymphatic system is <b> made up of the lymph nodes and lymph vessels. </b> Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that trap and destroy microbes, while lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes), throughout the body. </li>
										<br/>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Spleen:</b> The spleen is a vital organ located in the upper left abdomen. It acts as a blood filter, <b>removing old or damaged red blood cells and capturing microbes for destruction.</b> Additionally, the spleen plays a role in <b>producing antibodies and lymphocytes,</b> contributing to the body's immune response.</li>
										<br/>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Bone Marrow: </b> Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue found inside your bones, particularly in the hips, ribs, and sternum. It is responsible for <b>producing all types of blood cells, </b> including red blood cells for oxygen transport, white blood cells for immune defense, and platelets for blood clotting. </li>
										<br/>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Thymus: </b> The thymus is a gland located in the chest, just behind the breastbone. It plays a <b>crucial role in the maturation and development of T-lymphocytes, </b> a type of white blood cell that is essential for coordinating immune responses. The thymus gradually decreases in size with age but remains active in immune function throughout life.</li>
									</ol>
									<p id="text" class="normal">Together, these components form a powerful defense system that keeps you healthy and protects you from getting sick.<b> So, next time you feel a sneeze coming on, remember your immune system is working hard to keep you safe!</b></p>
									<hr />
									<h3 id="ButtonC">C. Immunity Type</h3>
									<p id="text" class="normal">You are immune to a disease when the antibodies of that disease are in your system. Antibodies are proteins that your body makes to fight off harmful invades like disease-carrying organisms. <b>But, here’s the catch: antibodies are disease-specific. </b>Meaning, each antibody is designed to target specific threats only. For example, a measles antibody will protect you if you are exposed to measles, but there will be no effect if you are exposed to different diseases. <b>Let’s look at two different types of immunity, which are active and passive.</b></p>
									<ol>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Active Immunity</b> is acquired when you are <b>exposed to the disease organism.</b> It will then trigger your immune system to actively produce antibodies to that disease. There are two ways to get active immunity:</li>
										<ul>
											<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Natural Immunity: </b>You acquire this <b>by actually catching the disease. </b> Your immune system will then learn how to make the right antibodies to defeat it.</li>
											<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Vaccine-Induced Immunity: Your body is introduced to a specific disease organism that is killed or weakened. </b>This way your body can learn to make antibodies for that specific disease without getting sick. If you do encounter the disease later, your immune system is ready to defend. Active immunity lasts a long time, sometimes for life.</li>
										</ul>
										<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Passive Immunity </b>is acquired when <b>you are given antibodies </b>rather than making them through your own immune system. There are two ways to get passive immunity: </li>
										<ul>
											<li id="text" class="normal"><b>From Mother: </b>Babies get passive immunity in a form of antibodies <b>from their mothers through the placenta before birth. </b> These antibodies would then protect them early in life.</li>
											<li id="text" class="normal"><b>Through Injections: </b>you could <b>also get injections of antibodies (like immune globulin) </b> for immediate protection against a specific disease. This protection is temporary, lasting only a few weeks or months.</li>
										</ul>
									</ol>
									<p id="text" class="normal">The cool thing about active immunity is that it's like building up your body's own defense system, but it takes time. On the other hand, passive immunity is quick, but it doesn't last as long. Both types of immunity play important roles in keeping us healthy and protected from diseases</p>
									<hr />
									<h3 id="ButtonD">D. How do vaccines work?</h3>
									<p id="text" class="normal"><b>Imagine! Immunisation works the same way as giving your body a cheat code against diseases. Here's the biological explanation of how vaccines work!</b></p>
									<p id="text" class="normal">Immunisation works by <b> copying the body’s natural immune response.</b> When you get a vaccine, your immune system is introduced to <b> the viruses, bacteria, or toxins. </b> The vaccine contains a tiny amount of these microbes, but they've been <b> weakened or killed </b>so they can not make you actually ill. Your body then <b> learns to recognize these intruders </b> and <b> creates special specific defenders </b> called antibodies for a targeted response.</p>
									<p id="text" class="normal">Think of your immune system as soldiers that remember every enemy it has defeated. These soldiers, known as <b> memory cells, keep a record of all the microbes they have battled. </b> The immune system will have memory of the pathogen’s distinctive characteristics. So, if the same microbes try to attack you in the future, your immune system can quickly recognize and defeat it before it can cause any harm. This <b>memory can last for years, decades, or even a lifetime, </b> keeping us protected from diseases. Some vaccines may require multiple doses over time to boost our immune response and create long-lasting protection. This is like giving our immune system a refresher course to make sure it's always ready to fight off any potential threats. <b>So, next time you get vaccinated, remember that you're giving your immune system a valuable lesson in defence, keeping you healthy and protected!</b></p>
									<hr />

								<!-- FUN FACT -->
									<h3 id="ButtonF">FUN FACT!</h3>
									<p id="text" class="normal">Do you know? When you get immunisation, you are actually shielding the whole community!</p>
									<blockquote id="text" class="normal">When most people in a community get vaccinated against a disease, it becomes harder for that disease to spread. This is called <b> herd immunity.</b> Through concerted vaccination efforts, we fortify our societal resilience against outbreaks and epidemics, thereby upholding the well-being and vitality of our populace. While no vaccine gives 100% protection and herd immunity isn't a complete shield, it provides significant protection, especially for vulnerable individuals. So, getting vaccinated not only safeguards you but also creates a protective barrier for those who can't receive vaccines. <b> It's a collective effort to keep everyone healthy and safe. If you can, choose to get vaccinated for the well-being of your community!</b></blockquote>
									<blockquote id="text" class="normal">In summary, the pivotal role of vaccines in disease prevention cannot be overstated. Their capacity to prime the immune system and confer immunity against specific pathogens represents a cornerstone of modern public health practice, underscoring the imperative of continued investment in vaccination initiatives to safeguard the health and welfare of our communities.</blockquote>

						<h2>Different kinds of infectious disease happening today with scientific evidence</h2>
						<p>Infectious diseases like COVID-19, influenza, hepatitis B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) present significant global health challenges. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has evolved into a pandemic, emphasizing the importance of vaccination and public health measures. Influenza, with its seasonal variability, underscores the necessity of annual vaccine updates and surveillance. Hepatitis B remains a major concern, but effective vaccines and antiviral therapies offer prevention and management strategies. Respiratory syncytial virus, particularly affecting vulnerable populations, highlights the importance of supportive care and prevention strategies. Scientific evidence drives efforts in understanding, managing, and mitigating the impact of these infectious diseases on public health and society.</p>

									<p>Did you know that Covid-19 is the most well-known infectious disease in the global worldwide right now? COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus Disease 2019, is an infectious disease that exists today, according to scientific data. It was originally discovered in Wuhan in December 2019, and was later recognised on January 7, 2020. COVID-19 spreads mostly through respiratory organs when an infected person coughs, flu, sneezes, or speaks, but it can also be transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth, or eyes. COVID-19 can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ failure, and mortality, especially in elderly adults and those with underlying medical problems. As of January 12, 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recorded nearly 88 million laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1.8 million deaths.</p>

										<h2>Influenza</h2>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, with three primary types: A, B, and C. Among these, Influenza A typically accounts for a larger proportion of reported cases compared to Influenza B, although there can be notable fluctuations from year to year. Influenza C viruses, while less frequently encountered, tend to induce milder respiratory symptoms. Turning our attention to Malaysia, I would like to draw your focus to the period spanning from January 2006 to December 2019. During this timeframe, Malaysia reported a total of 2963 instances of influenza infection, with monthly case counts ranging from zero to 274. Notably, the highest number of reported cases occurred in 2009, totaling 661 cases, representing approximately 22.3% of the cumulative cases during this period.</p>

										<h2>Hepatitis B</h2>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> Hepatitis B, is an infectious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). This virus is primarily transmitted through exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, vaginal secretions, and sperm. Modes of transmission include mother-to-child transmission during childbirth, unprotected sexual contact with an infected individual, and the sharing of needles or syringes among intravenous drug users. According to research conducted by the Global Burden of Disease, the year 2013 saw a substantial impact of Hepatitis B on global health, with an estimated 686,000 deaths attributed to this disease. The age-standardized death rate was reported at 5.9 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Of particular concern, 300,000 deaths were directly linked to liver cancer associated with Hepatitis B infection, while 317,400 deaths were attributed to cirrhosis of the liver resulting from Hepatitis B. </p>

										<h2>Respiratory syncytial virus</h2>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> RSV is a prevalent respiratory virus known to cause mild, cold-like symptoms, but it can progress to more severe respiratory illnesses, particularly in infants, young children, older adults, and individuals with compromised immune systems.This virus primarily affects the respiratory tract, encompassing the nose, throat, windpipe, and lungs. While RSV may initially manifest with symptoms akin to the common cold—such as runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, and headache—it can escalate to more severe manifestations in young children, notably those under the age of 2. These severe symptoms may include difficulty breathing, wheezing, rapid breathing, and cyanosis, characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin. In the year 2000 alone, RSV accounted for a staggering number of healthcare encounters in the United States. Specifically, it led to approximately 1.7 million physician office visits, 402,000 emergency room visits, 236,000 hospital outpatient visits, and 86,000 hospitalizations among children under the age of 5. The financial burden associated with treating RSV was substantial, with hospitalizations alone costing $394 million, and an additional $258 million incurred for other medical encounters. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spanning the years 1979 to 1997, which revealed the significant toll of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on paediatric health. According to these assessments, it was determined that annually, between 200 to 500 children succumbed to RSV-associated illnesses. Furthermore, a separate study focusing on mortality during 1999 identified 390 infant deaths with probable links to RSV. </p>
